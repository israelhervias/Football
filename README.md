# FOOTBALL ANALYSIS PROJECT

The objective of this project is to carry out an analysis of the teams that have participated in the Champions League in the 2021/2022 season.

The data sources have been Transfermark, the official FIFA website and a kaggle database with the individual performance of all the players who have played in the competition.

For this project we have relied on python to perform the analysis, data collection and presentation through Streamlit and Power BI.
